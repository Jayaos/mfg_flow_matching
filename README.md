## High-dimensional Mean-Field Games by Particle-based Flow Matching

This repository contains code for the experiments in the paper **["High-dimensional Mean-Field Games by Particle-based Flow Matching"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01172)**.


### High-dimensional Gaussian Benchmark

The codes for the experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian benchmark are available in run_hd.py package. We used the same benchmark from **["Do Neural Optimal Transport Solvers Work? A Continuous Wasserstein-2 Benchmark"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/7a6a6127ff85640ec69691fb0f7cb1a2-Paper.pdf)**, available at **[the authors' github](https://github.com/iamalexkorotin/Wasserstein2Benchmark)**.

Below is the implementation example on notebook.
